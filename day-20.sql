-- Question:

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
 *
from break_schedule b
join locations l
  on b.location_id = l.location_id
JOIN cocoa_logs cl
on b.break_id = cl.break_id
join cocoa_types ct 
on cl.cocoa_id = ct.cocoa_id
