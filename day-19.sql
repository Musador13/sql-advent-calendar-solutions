-- Table Schema:
-- Table: holiday_orders
--   order_id: INT
--   customer_name: VARCHAR
--   gift_wrap: BOOLEAN
--   paper_used_meters: DECIMAL
--   delivery_status: VARCHAR
--   order_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

select 
  --*,
  sum(paper_used_meters) filter(where delivery_status = 'Delivered' and gift_wrap is true)
from holiday_orders
